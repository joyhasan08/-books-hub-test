# 📚 Book Listing App

A simple book listing application built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Zustand** for state management. Due to time constraints, this project does not include a backend or authentication.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Next.js (App Router)** – Frontend framework
- **Zustand** – State management (instead of a backend)
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling
- **Framer Motion** – Animations

## ⚡ Why No Backend & NextAuth?

### 1️⃣ **No Backend (PostgreSQL + Drizzle/Prisma)**
The original task suggested using PostgreSQL with Drizzle/Prisma for database management. However, due to time constraints, implementing a full backend was not feasible. Instead, Zustand is used to manage the application state on the client side.

### 2️⃣ **No NextAuth**
NextAuth.js is a great authentication solution, but since this project does not have a backend, implementing proper authentication wasn’t practical. As a workaround, a simple login page with predefined credentials is used.
